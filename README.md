Dice roll and character performance tracker. Made with Pathfinder in mind, but all changes so far work for any dice-based rpg. 

Changelog:
v.0.1.2: First GitHub release. Allows user to input a die roll in format xdy where x is the number of dice and y is the number of sides on each die. Each roll creates an instance of the roll class with attributes "number" and "sides," generates the die roll, and outputs the value of each individual die as well as the total of all dice.
